# Janus Worklog

## 2026-03-23

### M1: Local inference on Mac (standalone)

#### Setup
- Created project directory at `~/projects/janus/`
- Wrote end-state design document (`DESIGN.md`)
- Wrote v1 spec (`V1_SPEC.md`)
- Wrote PRD with protocol schema, data model, milestones, decision log (`PRD.md`)

#### Decisions made
- D1: Inference model — `mlx-community/Qwen3-4B-4bit` (Qwen3-4B, 4-bit quantization, ~2.3GB)
- D2: Session grant delivery — Option B (client presents signed grant on first contact, MPP-aligned)
- D3: Transport — Multipeer Connectivity (not raw BLE)
- D4: Quote round-trip — keep it (MPP challenge fidelity, <50ms cost)
- D5: Backend — Swift (Vapor) for shared crypto code

#### Implementation
- Created SPM package with `JanusShared` library and `JanusProvider` executable targets
- Implemented `TaskType` enum (translate, rewrite, summarize)
- Implemented `PricingTier` with classify-by-prompt-length logic (small/medium/large → 3/5/8 credits)
- Implemented `PromptTemplates` with system prompts per task type
- Implemented `MLXRunner` actor wrapping mlx-swift-lm's `ChatSession` for single-turn inference
- Implemented CLI entry point with interactive prompt loop

#### Issues encountered
- `swift build` cannot compile Metal shaders — MLX requires `xcodebuild` to generate `default.metallib` in `mlx-swift_Cmlx.bundle`
- Required Xcode.app installation (was only Command Line Tools)
- Required Metal Toolchain download (`xcodebuild -downloadComponent MetalToolchain`)
- Qwen3 defaults to "thinking mode" with `<think>` tags — fixed with `/no_think` prompt prefix and `stripThinkingTags` safety net

#### Build commands
- Build: `xcodebuild -scheme janus-provider -destination "platform=macOS" build`
- Test: `xcodebuild test -scheme Janus-Package -destination "platform=macOS" -only-testing:JanusSharedTests`
- Run: `/Users/soubhik/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/janus-*/Build/Products/Debug/janus-provider`

#### Results
- All 3 task types working: translate (0.3s), summarize (0.6s), rewrite (0.5s)
- Pricing tier classification correct at boundaries
- 6/6 unit tests passing
- Model cached at HuggingFace default cache path (~2.3GB, downloaded once)

#### Status: M1 COMPLETE

---

### M2: Multipeer Connectivity link

#### Implementation
- Added shared protocol types to JanusShared:
  - `MessageEnvelope` — common wrapper for all messages with type, ID, timestamp, sender, payload
  - `ServiceAnnounce` — provider identity, capabilities, pricing, availability
  - `MPCError` — shared transport error type
  - `MessageType` enum for all protocol message types
  - Shared `JSONEncoder.janus` / `JSONDecoder.janus` with ISO8601 dates and sorted keys
- Created Xcode project (`JanusApp/JanusApp.xcodeproj`) with two targets:
  - `JanusClient` — iOS SwiftUI app (iPhone)
  - `JanusProvider` — macOS SwiftUI app (Mac)
- Implemented `MPCAdvertiser` (macOS) — advertises provider, auto-sends ServiceAnnounce on connection
- Implemented `MPCBrowser` (iOS) — discovers providers, displays ServiceAnnounce info
- Implemented `DiscoveryView` (iOS) — scan button, connection status, provider info card
- Implemented `ProviderStatusView` (macOS) — advertising status, connected client, pricing display
- Info.plist files with NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription and NSBonjourServices for MPC
- MPC service type: `janus-ai`

#### Issues encountered
- Swift 6 strict concurrency: MPC delegate callbacks are nonisolated but need @MainActor state — used `nonisolated(unsafe)` for MPC objects
- iOS platform not installed in Xcode — downloading iOS simulator runtime (8.39 GB)
- `swift build` unusable for iOS targets — must use `xcodebuild` with proper Xcode project

#### Build commands
- Provider (macOS): `cd JanusApp && xcodebuild -project JanusApp.xcodeproj -scheme JanusProvider -destination "platform=macOS" build`
- Client (iOS): `cd JanusApp && xcodebuild -project JanusApp.xcodeproj -scheme JanusClient -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro" build`

#### Issues encountered (continued)
- `XCSwiftPackageProductDependency` in hand-crafted pbxproj was missing `package = R000000001` reference — Xcode saw the dependency name but couldn't resolve it to the local SPM package for building
- SPM package target (JanusShared) defaulted to Release config while Xcode project target (JanusClient) used Debug — caused build directory mismatch (`Release-iphoneos/` vs `Debug-iphoneos/`). Fixed once scheme-based build used with proper simulator destination.
- iOS simulator runtime downloaded as iOS 26.3 (not 26.2 as SDK version suggests)

#### Build commands (final)
- Provider (macOS): `cd JanusApp && xcodebuild -project JanusApp.xcodeproj -scheme JanusProvider -destination "platform=macOS" build`
- Client (iOS Simulator): `cd JanusApp && xcodebuild -project JanusApp.xcodeproj -scheme JanusClient -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro" build`
- Client (device, no signing): `cd JanusApp && xcodebuild -project JanusApp.xcodeproj -target JanusClient -configuration Debug -sdk iphoneos CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO SYMROOT="$(pwd)/build" build`

#### Results
- JanusProvider (macOS) builds successfully
- JanusClient (iOS) builds successfully for both simulator and device
- Both targets correctly resolve JanusShared via local SPM package

#### Verification
- JanusClient launched on iPhone 17 Pro simulator — no crashes
- JanusProvider launched on macOS — no crashes
- MPC framework active on client (GCKSession routing table initialized)
- MPC cannot fully test peer discovery in simulator — real device needed for end-to-end MPC testing

#### Real device test
- JanusClient deployed to physical iPhone (free Apple ID signing, team 2GKGGY6HZ8)
- Required: Developer Mode enabled on iPhone, developer profile trusted in Settings → General → VPN & Device Management
- JanusProvider running on Mac, JanusClient running on iPhone
- Both devices show "Connected" — MPC peer discovery, invitation, and ServiceAnnounce delivery all working
- Provider info card displayed on iPhone with pricing and task capabilities

#### Status: M2 COMPLETE

---

### M3: Cryptographic session model

#### Implementation
- Added `JanusShared/Crypto/` module:
  - `KeyPair.swift` — Ed25519 key generation, base64 import/export via CryptoKit (Curve25519)
  - `Signer.swift` — Signs newline-delimited field arrays, returns base64 signature
  - `Verifier.swift` — Verifies base64 signatures against public key
  - `CryptoError` enum for invalid base64/signature/verification failures
- Added protocol message types to `JanusShared/Protocol/`:
  - `PromptRequest` — client→provider, includes optional `SessionGrant` for first contact
  - `QuoteResponse` — provider→client, price quote with expiry
  - `SpendAuthorization` — client→provider, cumulative spend with client signature
  - `InferenceResponse` — provider→client, output text + signed `Receipt`
  - `ErrorResponse` — provider→client, typed error codes for all 9 verification failures
- Added model types to `JanusShared/Models/`:
  - `SessionGrant` — backend-signed grant with `signableFields` for canonical field ordering
  - `SpendState` — tracks cumulative spend + sequence number, `advance()` method
  - `Receipt` — provider-signed receipt with `signableFields`
- Added `JanusShared/Verification/SpendVerifier.swift`:
  - Full 9-step verification from PRD §8
  - `verify()` — validates authorization against grant, spend state, and quote
  - `verifyGrant()` — validates backend signature on session grant
  - `VerificationError` enum maps to `ErrorResponse.ErrorCode`
- Added tests:
  - `CryptoTests.swift` — 9 tests: key gen, sign/verify round-trip, wrong key, tampered fields, bad signature, base64 import
  - `SpendVerifierTests.swift` — 14 tests: happy path, sequential spends, all 9 verification failure modes, grant verification
  - `ProtocolTests.swift` — 17 tests: encode/decode round-trips for all 7 message types, envelope wrap/unwrap/serialize, signable fields, SpendState advance

#### Results
- 46/46 tests passing (9 crypto + 6 pricing + 17 protocol + 14 spend verification)
- JanusProvider (macOS) builds with new JanusShared code
- JanusClient (iOS) builds with new JanusShared code
- No new dependencies — CryptoKit is built into Apple platforms

#### Status: M3 COMPLETE

---

### M4: End-to-end flow

#### Implementation
- Added `DemoConfig` to JanusShared — deterministic backend keypair (SHA256 seed), hardcoded public key for grant verification, demo session defaults (100 credits, 1hr expiry)
- **Provider (macOS):**
  - `ProviderEngine` — orchestrates full pipeline: receive PromptRequest → cache grant → classify tier → issue QuoteResponse → verify SpendAuthorization (9-step) → run MLX inference → sign receipt → return InferenceResponse
  - Copied `MLXRunner` and `PromptTemplates` into Xcode provider target
  - Added MLXLLM + MLXLMCommon as SPM dependencies for macOS target
  - `ProviderStatusView` updated — shows model loading status, connection, activity log (last request/response, total served)
  - Auto-loads model on launch, auto-starts advertising
- **Client (iOS):**
  - `SessionManager` — generates client Ed25519 keypair, creates demo session grant (signed by hardcoded backend key), tracks cumulative spend state, stores receipts
  - `ClientEngine` — state machine (idle → waitingForQuote → waitingForResponse → complete/error), forwards browser published properties via Combine for SwiftUI observation, auto-accepts quotes by signing SpendAuthorization
  - `PromptView` — task type picker (segmented), text input, target language / rewrite style options, submit button with loading state, result card with receipt info, balance display, error display
  - `DiscoveryView` updated — creates session on provider connection, shows session credits, navigates to PromptView
- Updated `MPCAdvertiser` to accept `providerPubkey` parameter for ServiceAnnounce
- Updated `project.pbxproj` — 6 new source files (3 client + 3 provider), 2 new SPM product deps (MLXLLM, MLXLMCommon)

#### Issues encountered
- Nested ObservableObject problem: SwiftUI only observes `@Published` on the direct `@StateObject`. Nested `ObservableObject`s (MPCBrowser inside ClientEngine, ProviderEngine inside coordinator) don't propagate changes. Fixed by forwarding properties via Combine `assign(to:)` on client, and using separate `@StateObject`s on provider.

#### Build commands
- Provider (macOS): `cd JanusApp && xcodebuild -project JanusApp.xcodeproj -scheme JanusProvider -destination "platform=macOS" build`
- Client (iOS device): `security unlock-keychain && cd JanusApp && xcodebuild -project JanusApp.xcodeproj -scheme JanusClient -destination "id=00008140-001E7526022B001C" -allowProvisioningUpdates build`
- Deploy: `xcrun devicectl device install app --device 00008140-001E7526022B001C <path-to-app>`

#### Results
- Full end-to-end flow verified on real devices (iPhone + MacBook)
- PromptRequest → QuoteResponse → SpendAuthorization → MLX inference → InferenceResponse with signed receipt
- All 3 task types working over MPC (translate, rewrite, summarize)
- Session grant delivered and verified on first request
- Credits deducted correctly, receipts displayed
- 46/46 unit tests still passing

#### Status: M4 COMPLETE

---

### M5: Polish and demo

#### Implementation

- **Client — PromptView polish:**
  - Added visual balance bar with progress indicator (blue when >20%, red when low)
  - "Insufficient credits" warning when balance drops below smallest tier cost (3 credits)
  - Clear prompt text after submit for quick sequential entries
  - Keyboard dismisses on scroll (`.scrollDismissesKeyboard(.interactively)`)
  - Collapsible response history section (shows all past results with task type, prompt preview, response preview, credits charged)
  - Dismissable error cards (tap "Dismiss" to clear and reset to idle)
  - Disconnect banner when provider drops mid-session, with "Back" button
  - Auto-pops back to DiscoveryView after 2s if provider disconnects while idle

- **Client — ClientEngine improvements:**
  - Disconnect detection during active request (waitingForQuote/waitingForResponse) — sets error state with "Provider disconnected during request" message
  - Response history tracking: stores (taskType, prompt, InferenceResponse) tuples
  - `canAffordRequest` computed property checks remaining credits >= smallest tier (3)
  - Cleans up pending state (taskType, promptText) on error and completion

- **Provider — ProviderEngine improvements:**
  - Request log: capped at 50 entries, shows timestamp, task type, prompt preview, response preview, credits earned, error flag
  - Active session count tracking
  - Total credits earned counter
  - Error logging: all `sendError` calls create log entries
  - Expired quote cleanup: stale quotes purged on each new quote creation
  - Request cache cleanup: removes cached PromptRequest after inference completes

- **Provider — ProviderStatusView redesign:**
  - Compact status cards for Model and Network status with color-coded indicators
  - Connection card showing client name + active session count
  - Stats row: requests served, credits earned, error count
  - Scrollable request log with green/red status dots, timestamps, task type badges, credit amounts
  - Version label updated from "M4 — End-to-End" to "v1 Demo"

#### Results
- JanusProvider (macOS) builds successfully
- JanusClient (iOS Simulator) builds successfully
- 46/46 unit tests still passing
- Edge cases handled: disconnect mid-request, insufficient credits, expired quotes

#### Status: M5 COMPLETE

## v1.1: Session Syncing

### Step 1: Persistence layer

#### Implementation
- Added `JanusShared/Persistence/SessionStore.swift`:
  - `PersistedClientSession` — stores keypair (base64), session grant, spend state, receipts, grantDelivered flag
  - `PersistedProviderState` — stores provider ID, keypair (base64), known sessions, spend ledger, receipts issued, stats
  - `JanusStore` — simple JSON file persistence using Application Support directory. `save()`, `load()`, `delete()` methods.
- Updated `SessionManager` (client):
  - `restore(providerID:)` static method tries to load persisted session. Returns nil if expired or wrong provider.
  - `persist()` called after session creation and after each `recordSpend()`
  - `clearPersistedSession()` for manual reset
- Updated `ClientEngine`:
  - `createSession()` tries `SessionManager.restore()` before creating new session
  - Keeps sessionManager on disconnect (persisted session survives reconnect)
- Updated `ProviderEngine`:
  - Restores provider ID + keypair from persisted state (stable identity across restarts)
  - Restores known sessions + spend ledger (returning clients work without re-presenting grant)
  - `persistState()` called after new session cached and after spend state advances
  - Stores receipts issued for future settlement
- Updated `ProviderStatusView`:
  - Provider ID loaded from persisted state if available (stable across restarts)
- Added `PersistenceTests.swift` — 7 tests:
  - Save/load round-trip, load nonexistent returns nil, delete removes file
  - Client session round-trip (keypair restore, spend state, receipts, isValid, remainingCredits)
  - Expired session correctly reports invalid
  - Provider state round-trip (sessions, ledger, stats, keypair restore)
  - Save overwrites previous value

#### Issues encountered
- Provider persistence file was empty on first test — old binary (M5, pre-persistence) was still running. Rebuilt and relaunched fixed it.
- Client history lost on reconnect — `PersistedClientSession` added `history: [HistoryEntry]` field, but old files on iPhone (written before history was added) didn't have this key. `JSONDecoder` threw `keyNotFound`, `try?` returned nil, and `SessionManager.restore()` fell through to creating a brand new session. Fixed with custom `init(from:)` using `decodeIfPresent` to default `history` to `[]`.
- Provider request log not persisting — `LogEntry` was not `Codable` and not included in `PersistedProviderState`. Fixed by making `LogEntry` Codable, adding `PersistedLogEntry` to JanusShared, persisting log in `appendLog()`, and restoring on init. Same `decodeIfPresent` pattern for backwards compat.

#### Results
- JanusProvider (macOS): BUILD SUCCEEDED
- JanusClient (iOS): BUILD SUCCEEDED, verified on real iPhone
- 54/54 tests passing (46 original + 8 persistence tests including backwards compat)
- Persistence directory: `~/Library/Application Support/Janus/` (macOS), app sandbox (iOS)
- Verified on real devices:
  - Client restart: credits, receipts, and response history persist
  - Provider restart: sessions, spend ledger, request log, stats, and provider identity persist
  - Cross-restart: client reconnects to restarted provider, resumes existing session without re-presenting grant

#### Status: Step 1 COMPLETE

---

### Step 2: Vapor backend + client/provider wiring

#### Implementation
- **Vapor backend server** (`JanusBackend/`):
  - Separate SPM package to isolate server-only dependencies (Vapor) from the main project
  - `@main` async entry point using `Application.make(.detect())`
  - Uses `DemoConfig` deterministic keypair — grants are verifiable by existing providers
  - In-memory actor-based stores (`InMemorySessionStore`, `InMemoryProviderStore`)
  - 4 endpoints:
    - `GET /status` — health check, session/provider counts
    - `POST /providers/register` — register provider ID + public key
    - `POST /sessions` — create backend-signed `SessionGrant` (requires registered provider)
    - `POST /sessions/settle` — provider submits final spend for reconciliation
  - `VaporExtensions.swift` — retroactive `Content` conformance for `SessionGrant` and `Receipt`
  - Build: `cd JanusBackend && swift build`
  - Run: `cd JanusBackend && .build/debug/JanusBackend serve --hostname 0.0.0.0 --port 8080`

- **`SessionBackend` protocol** (`JanusShared/BackendAPI.swift`):
  - Abstracts over the session funding/settlement backend
  - Three operations map to MPP payment channel concepts:
    - `fundSession` → open + fund a payment channel
    - `registerProvider` → announce provider identity to network
    - `settleSession` → close + settle a payment channel
  - `HTTPSessionBackend` — concrete implementation using URLSession → Vapor
  - When MPP/Tempo arrives, swap for `MPPSessionBackend` without touching client/provider code

- **Client (`SessionManager`):**
  - `init(providerID:)` replaced with `create(providerID:)` async factory method
  - Calls `backend.fundSession()` to get a real grant from the server
  - Falls back to local DemoConfig self-signing if backend is unreachable (offline mode)
  - Backend private key no longer needed on the client

- **Provider (`ProviderEngine`):**
  - `registerWithBackend()` — calls `backend.registerProvider()` on startup
  - `settleSession(_:)` — calls `backend.settleSession()` with receipts
  - `@Published var backendRegistered` — tracks registration status for UI

- **Provider UI (`ProviderStatusView`):**
  - Backend status card (green "Registered" / orange "Not registered")
  - Calls `registerWithBackend()` on launch alongside model loading

- **ATS (App Transport Security):**
  - Added `NSAllowsLocalNetworking` to both Info.plist files
  - Allows plain HTTP to local network IPs without disabling ATS globally

- **Config:**
  - `DemoConfig.backendBaseURL` — Mac's LAN IP (`http://10.0.0.117:8080`)

#### Issues encountered
- Vapor `Application(.detect())` deprecated — used `Application.make(.detect())` async API
- `@main` conflicts with `main.swift` — renamed to `App.swift`
- Protocol methods can't have default parameter values — must pass `nil` explicitly for optional `maxCredits`
- iOS ATS blocks plain HTTP by default — `NSAllowsLocalNetworking` is the surgical fix for local dev

#### Results
- JanusBackend: BUILD SUCCEEDED, all 4 endpoints tested with curl
- JanusProvider (macOS): BUILD SUCCEEDED
- JanusClient (iOS): BUILD SUCCEEDED, deployed to real iPhone
- 54/54 unit tests still passing
- Verified on real devices:
  - Provider registers with backend on launch (status shows "Registered")
  - Client requests grant from backend when connecting to provider
  - Full end-to-end flow works: backend-signed grant → MPC → quote → authorization → inference → receipt
  - Offline fallback: client self-signs if backend unreachable

#### Status: Step 2 COMPLETE

---

### Step 3: Provider settlement on disconnect

#### Implementation
- **`MPCAdvertiser`:**
  - Added `onClientDisconnected` callback, fired on `.notConnected` state change
  - Wired in `ProviderStatusView` to trigger `engine.settleAllSessions()`

- **`ProviderEngine` — settlement trigger:**
  - `settleSession(_:) -> Bool` — calls `backend.settleSession()`, returns success/failure
  - `settleAllSessions()` — iterates all sessions with unsettled spend, calls `settleSession()` for each
  - Logs settlement success/failure to request log

- **Re-settlement support:**
  - `settledSpends: [String: Int]` tracks last settled cumulative spend per session (not just boolean)
  - On disconnect: only settles if `ledger.cumulativeSpend > settledSpends[sessionID]`
  - Allows client to reconnect, spend more, disconnect again — provider re-settles at the higher amount
  - Persisted via `PersistedProviderState.settledSpends` with `decodeIfPresent` backwards compat

- **Backend re-settlement:**
  - `InMemorySessionStore.settle()` changed from `-> Bool` to `-> Int?`
  - Accepts re-settlement if new spend >= previous settled spend (monotonically increasing)
  - Rejects if spend decreased (returns nil → 409)

- **Bug fix — settlement on failure:**
  - Original code marked session as settled even when HTTP call failed
  - Fixed: only update `settledSpends` when backend confirms settlement
  - Failed settlements are retried on next disconnect

#### Issues encountered
- DHCP lease changed Mac IP from `10.0.0.117` to `10.0.0.119` — hardcoded `DemoConfig.backendBaseURL` had to be updated and both apps rebuilt. Future improvement: dynamic backend URL discovery.

#### Results
- JanusProvider (macOS): BUILD SUCCEEDED
- JanusBackend: BUILD SUCCEEDED
- 54/54 unit tests still passing
- Verified on real devices (reconnect scenario):
  - Round 1: Client connects, translates "How is life?" (3 credits), disconnects → settled at 3
  - Round 2: Client reconnects, translates "What an awesome world is this?" (3 more), disconnects → re-settled at 6
  - Provider log shows both settlement entries with correct cumulative amounts
  - `settledSpends` correctly tracks `D0A1C067... → 6`

#### Status: Step 3 COMPLETE

---

### v1.1 Session Syncing — COMPLETE

#### Deferred: SessionSync / SettlementNotice messages (future hardening)
- **Scenario:** If the provider crashes mid-inference after advancing its spend ledger but before sending InferenceResponse, the client and provider ledgers diverge. Neither side knows.
- **Fix (when needed):** Add `SessionSync` message (provider → client: "your current spend is X") and `SettlementNotice` (provider → client: "I settled session Y with backend for Z credits"). Allows both sides to reconcile after disruptions.
- **Priority:** Low — current persistence + settlement handles restarts and reconnects. This is an edge case for a future robustness pass.

---

## v1.2: Better Receipts

### Client-side receipt verification

#### Implementation
- **`ClientEngine.handleInferenceResponse()`** — two new checks before accepting any response:
  1. **Quote-price match:** `creditsCharged` must equal `currentQuote.priceCredits` — prevents overcharging
  2. **Receipt signature verification:** Ed25519 signature on receipt verified against provider's public key (from `ServiceAnnounce.providerPubkey`) — prevents forged/tampered receipts
  - If either check fails, client rejects the response, shows error, does not deduct credits

- **`ReceiptVerificationTests.swift`** — 8 new tests:
  - Valid receipt signature passes
  - Receipt signed by wrong provider (impersonation) rejected
  - Tampered `creditsCharged` field rejected
  - Tampered `cumulativeSpend` field rejected
  - Empty signature rejected
  - Quote-price match accepted / mismatch rejected
  - Sequential receipts with monotonic spend all verify independently

#### Deferred: Receipt-based recovery
- Custom recovery against Vapor backend would be throwaway — MPP/Tempo replaces the recovery model entirely (payment channels on shared ledger, keypair + latest receipt = full recovery)
- Only durable investment: store keypair in recoverable location (Keychain with iCloud sync) — deferred to MPP milestone

#### Results
- JanusClient (iOS): BUILD SUCCEEDED, deployed to real iPhone
- 62/62 unit tests passing (54 original + 8 receipt verification)
- Verified on real device: happy path works with receipt verification active

#### Status: v1.2 COMPLETE

---

## v1.3: Multiple Simultaneous Users

#### Implementation
- **`MPCAdvertiser` — multi-peer support:**
  - `connectedClients: [MCPeerID: String]` replaces single `clientPeerID`
  - `senderToPeer: [String: MCPeerID]` maps message sender IDs to MPC peers for reply routing
  - Auto-registers sender→peer mapping on every received message
  - ServiceAnnounce sent to each peer individually on connect
  - Per-peer disconnect with cleanup of sender mappings
  - `send(_:to:)` routes to specific peer by sender ID
  - `onClientDisconnected` now passes client name (for logging)

- **`ProviderEngine` — targeted message routing:**
  - `sendMessage` callback changed from `(MessageEnvelope) -> Void` to `(MessageEnvelope, String) -> Void` — includes target sender ID
  - `sessionToSender: [String: String]` maps session IDs to sender IDs for routing replies
  - All `send()` and `sendError()` calls pass session ID for correct routing
  - Session data structures already multi-session (dictionaries) — no changes needed

- **`ProviderStatusView` — multi-client UI:**
  - Connection card shows list of connected clients (not just one name)
  - Displays client count + session count

- **`MultiSessionTests.swift`** — 8 new tests:
  - Two sessions track spend independently
  - Exhausting one session doesn't affect another
  - Verifier accepts two clients on same provider
  - Client A can't spend on client B's session (cross-session attack rejected)
  - Settlement tracks per-session
  - Re-settlement detects increased spend
  - Receipts from different sessions verify independently (cross-check fails)
  - Multi-session provider state persists and restores correctly

#### MPC stability fixes (multi-phone testing)

**Problem 1: Connect/disconnect loop with two phones.**
When both phones connected, they kept cycling between connecting and disconnecting. Root cause: `foundPeer` callback was `nonisolated` and called `invitePeer` immediately every time MPC discovered the provider — even while already connecting or connected. With two phones, duplicate invitations confused the provider's MCSession, triggering drops.
- Fix: moved `foundPeer` logic to `@MainActor`, added guard `connectionState == .disconnected` before inviting.

**Problem 2: Auto-reconnect never triggered after disconnect.**
Phone would show "disconnected" but never reconnect. Root cause: race condition between two MPC delegate callbacks. `lostPeer` (browser delegate) fired first and set `providerPeerID = nil`. Then `.notConnected` (session delegate) fired, checked `peerID == providerPeerID`, found nil, skipped `scheduleReconnect()`.
- Fix: both `lostPeer` and `.notConnected` now trigger reconnect independently. `.notConnected` checks `connectionState != .disconnected` instead of peerID. Whichever fires first handles it, second is a no-op.

**Problem 3: Stuck at `.connecting` forever.**
After auto-reconnect, client would find provider and send invitation, but MPC's invitation timeout callback sometimes never fired — client stuck at `.connecting` permanently.
- Fix: added `startConnectionTimeout()` — if still `.connecting` after 10 seconds, forces session reset and retries.

**Problem 4: Phantom connections (both sides show "connected", but data doesn't flow).**
Provider showed clients as connected, clients showed connected, but requests got stuck at "getting quote" — provider never received the messages, or sent responses that never arrived. MPC's `session.send()` succeeded (buffered internally) but data never reached the other side. MPC didn't fire any disconnect callbacks.
- Attempted fix 1: foreground health check (`willEnterForegroundNotification`) — checks `session.connectedPeers` when app returns to foreground, forces reconnect if stale. Helped for background/foreground transitions but didn't catch phantom connections while app was in foreground.
- Attempted fix 2: provider-side stale peer cleanup timer (every 15s, compare `connectedClients` against `session.connectedPeers`). Didn't help — MPC's `connectedPeers` also reported the phantom peers as connected.
- Attempted fix 3: ping/pong heartbeat (client pings every 10s, waits 5s for pong, declares dead if no response). This correctly detected phantom connections BUT the heartbeat traffic itself caused more disconnects — during inference (which takes seconds), the pong response was delayed, and multiple pings from multiple clients created MPC contention. Reverted.

**Problem 5 (root cause): One phone backgrounding broke ALL connections.**
The actual root cause of phantom connections and instability: MPC used a single shared `MCSession` for all peers. When one phone locked (iOS kills background MPC connections), the shared session became unstable for ALL peers — the other phone's connection would silently die or become phantom.
- **Final fix: per-client MCSession isolation.** Changed `MPCAdvertiser` from `session: MCSession` (one shared) to `clientSessions: [MCPeerID: MCSession]` (one per client). Each incoming invitation creates a dedicated session via `createSession(for:)`. One client disconnecting only affects its own session. This eliminated all cross-client interference.

**Client-side auto-reconnect (`MPCBrowser`) — kept from earlier fixes:**
- `foundPeer` guard (Problem 1 fix)
- `scheduleReconnect()` from both `lostPeer` and `.notConnected` (Problem 2 fix)
- Connection timeout at 10 seconds (Problem 3 fix)
- Foreground health check (Problem 4 partial fix — still useful for detecting stale state after backgrounding)
- Stop browsing on connect — prevents stale `foundPeer` callbacks

**Approaches tried and reverted:**
- Exponential backoff + jitter on reconnect — over-engineered, the core issue was shared sessions not reconnect timing
- Heartbeat ping/pong — correct in theory but caused more disconnects in practice due to MPC traffic contention during inference
- Provider stale peer cleanup timer — unnecessary with per-client sessions

**Key lesson:** The fix was architectural (isolate sessions) not behavioral (detect and recover from bad connections). We spent significant time adding detection/recovery mechanisms that made things worse because they added MPC traffic and complexity to an already fragile shared session. The per-client session change was ~50 lines and solved everything.

#### Provider UI fix
- Connection card now shows "X connected now" (green/orange) and "Y sessions total" (gray) separately — distinguishes live MPC peers from durable Janus payment sessions.

#### Known issue (deferred)
- **Spend state divergence on mid-request disconnect:** If provider runs inference and advances spend ledger but client never receives the response (MPC drops mid-flight), client and provider sequence numbers diverge. Next request from client gets "sequence mismatch" error. Fix: SessionSync message (provider tells client current spend state on reconnect). Deferred — same issue noted in v1.1.

#### Results
- JanusProvider (macOS): BUILD SUCCEEDED
- JanusClient (iOS): BUILD SUCCEEDED
- 70/70 unit tests passing (62 previous + 8 multi-session)
- Single-phone smoke test: provider registered, session created, iPhone auto-connected — no regression
- Multi-phone test (2 iPhones → 1 Mac provider):
  - Both phones connect and create independent sessions
  - Both phones submit requests and receive independent responses
  - One phone locking does NOT affect the other phone's connection (per-client session isolation working)
  - Phone unlocking → auto-reconnect within ~2 seconds → new requests work
  - Provider correctly shows "2 connected now, 2 sessions total"
  - MPC drops handled by auto-reconnect — phones recover within ~2 seconds

#### Status: v1.3 COMPLETE

## v1.3.1: Provider UI Redesign

#### Implementation
- **Provider dashboard overhaul (`ProviderStatusView`):**
  - Compact horizontal header bar with machine name
  - Status pills (model/network/backend) instead of large status cards
  - Stats strip: Served, Credits Earned, Connected clients, Total sessions
  - Per-client cards in a 2-column `LazyVGrid` — cards sit side by side instead of stacking vertically
  - Each card shows: client name with unique session ID suffix (e.g. "iPhone (a3f2b1)"), connection status dot, credits used, remaining, sessions, requests
  - Expandable "Recent Requests" dropdown inside each card (`ClientLogDropdown`) — collapsed by default, tap to expand with animated chevron
  - Global "All Activity" log at the bottom

- **Data model changes for per-client grouping:**
  - Added `sessionID: String?` to `LogEntry` and `PersistedLogEntry` (optional for backward compat)
  - Added `ClientSummary` struct and computed property on `ProviderEngine` — groups sessions by senderID, aggregates spend/request/error data
  - Added `displayName(forSender:)` and `isConnected(senderID:)` helpers on `MPCAdvertiser`
  - Client name disambiguation: appends last 6 chars of senderID to device name (both phones named "iPhone" by default)

#### Results
- JanusProvider (macOS): BUILD SUCCEEDED
- JanusClient (iOS): BUILD SUCCEEDED
- 70/70 unit tests still passing
- Two client cards display side by side with unique identifiers

#### Status: v1.3.1 COMPLETE

## v1.4: SessionSync (Spend State Divergence Fix)

### Problem
If the provider completes inference and advances its spend ledger but the client never receives the response (MPC drops mid-flight), the two sides diverge:
- Provider: sequence N+1, cumulative spend X+price
- Client: sequence N, cumulative spend X

Every subsequent request from the client fails with "sequence mismatch" because the client sends sequence N+1 but the provider expects N+2. Previously required app reinstall to recover.

### Implementation
- **New message type:** `sessionSync` added to `MessageType` enum
- **New model:** `SessionSync` (`Sources/JanusShared/Protocol/SessionSync.swift`) — carries the missed `InferenceResponse` (which includes the signed receipt + output text)
- **Provider (`ProviderEngine`):**
  - Stores last `InferenceResponse` per session in `lastResponses: [String: InferenceResponse]`
  - On `sequenceMismatch` error during spend verification, checks if a stored response exists for that session
  - If yes, sends `SessionSync` instead of error — client gets the missed receipt and can recover
  - If no stored response, falls back to error (shouldn't happen in practice since requests are sequential)
- **Client (`ClientEngine`):**
  - Handles `.sessionSync` message type
  - Verifies receipt signature before trusting the provider's state (same Ed25519 check as normal responses)
  - Rejects sync if receipt is forged or tampered
  - On valid sync: updates `SpendState` via `SessionManager.syncSpendState()`, adds missed response to history as "(recovered)", resets to idle
- **Client (`SessionManager`):**
  - Added `syncSpendState(to:)` — reconstructs `SpendState` from the receipt's cumulative spend and increments sequence number

### Security model
- Provider cannot lie about spend: SessionSync includes a signed receipt, and the client verifies the signature against the provider's public key
- Provider cannot inflate credits: the receipt's `creditsCharged` was originally authorized by the client's `SpendAuthorization`
- Provider cannot forge transactions: no `SpendAuthorization` from the client = no valid receipt to include in sync
- Tampered receipt fields (changed amounts) fail signature verification

### Tests
- **`SessionSyncTests.swift`** — 6 new tests:
  - `testSessionSyncRoundTrip` — encode/decode through MessageEnvelope
  - `testDivergenceAndRecovery` — full scenario: 2 requests succeed → provider advances on 3rd but client misses it → stale auth rejected → sync state → retry succeeds
  - `testSyncReceiptSignatureValid` — valid receipt passes verification
  - `testSyncReceiptRejectsWrongSigner` — receipt signed by impersonator rejected
  - `testSyncReceiptRejectsTamperedAmount` — receipt with changed creditsCharged rejected
  - `testSyncDoesNotAllowSpendBeyondBudget` — sync doesn't bypass budget enforcement

### Results
- JanusProvider (macOS): BUILD SUCCEEDED
- JanusClient (iOS): BUILD SUCCEEDED
- 76/76 unit tests passing (70 previous + 6 SessionSync)
- Verified on real devices:
  - Sent request from iPhone, locked screen during inference to kill MPC connection
  - Provider completed inference, logged response, but phone never received it
  - Unlocked phone, sent new request — provider detected sequence mismatch, sent SessionSync
  - Phone auto-recovered: state synced, next request worked normally
  - No app reinstall needed

#### Status: v1.4 COMPLETE

---

## v1.5: MPP/Tempo Integration (In Progress)

### Goal
Replace the toy Vapor backend with real Tempo payment channels — on-chain escrow smart contracts on Tempo testnet. Clients deposit tokens (one tx), send signed cumulative vouchers off-chain per request, and settle on-chain at session end (one tx).

### Step 1: Ethereum Primitives

#### Implementation
- **Dependencies added:**
  - `CryptoSwift` v1.9.0 (10.5k stars) — battle-tested keccak256 implementation. Pure Swift, no heavy deps.
  - `swift-secp256k1` pinned to v0.21.1 — product renamed from `secp256k1` to `P256K` in v0.20.0. v0.22.0 added a mandatory build plugin that broke xcodebuild, so pinned to last stable version without it.

- **`Sources/JanusShared/Ethereum/Keccak256.swift`:**
  - Thin wrapper around CryptoSwift's `SHA3(.keccak256)` — Ethereum uses Keccak-256 (NOT SHA3-256; different padding byte)

- **`Sources/JanusShared/Ethereum/EthKeyPair.swift`:**
  - `EthKeyPair` — secp256k1 keypair using `P256K.Signing.PrivateKey` / `P256K.Recovery.PrivateKey`
  - Ethereum address derivation: `keccak256(uncompressed_pubkey[1..65])[-20:]`
  - `signRecoverable(messageHash:)` → `EthSignature(r, s, v)` for EIP-712 voucher signing
  - `EthAddress` — 20-byte address with EIP-55 checksum encoding, Codable
  - `EthSignature` — recoverable ECDSA (r, s, v), 65-byte compact representation
  - Hex utilities: `Data(ethHex:)`, `.ethHex`, `.ethHexPrefixed`

- **`Sources/JanusShared/Ethereum/ABI.swift`:**
  - Minimal Solidity ABI encoding for EIP-712 struct hashing and contract calls
  - Supports `uint256`, `address`, `bytes32`, `bool`
  - `ABI.encode()` (standard, padded to 32 bytes) and `ABI.encodePacked()` (tight packing)

- **`Sources/JanusShared/Ethereum/EIP712.swift`:**
  - EIP-712 typed structured data hashing and signing
  - `TypeDefinition` with `typeHash` computation
  - `Domain` separator (name, version, chainId, verifyingContract)
  - `hashStruct()` and `signableHash()` (`keccak256("\x19\x01" || domainSeparator || structHash)`)

#### Tests
- **`EthereumTests.swift`** — 19 tests:
  - Keccak256: empty string vector, "hello world" vector, NOT-SHA3 verification
  - Hex: round-trip, prefixed, invalid odd-length rejection
  - EthAddress: from hex, EIP-55 checksum (Vitalik's address), Codable round-trip
  - EthKeyPair: generation (sizes, 0x04 prefix), deterministic address, Hardhat account #0 address vector, recoverable signature (r/s/v sizes)
  - ABI: uint256 encoding, address left-padding, packed encoding sizes, bool encoding
  - EIP-712: type hash computation, domain separator determinism, signable hash with 0x1901 prefix

#### Results
- JanusShared: BUILD SUCCEEDED
- 95/95 unit tests passing (76 previous + 19 Ethereum)
- Hardhat account #0 test vector passes: private key `0xac0974...` → address `0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266`

#### Status: Step 1 COMPLETE

---

### Step 2: Tempo Voucher & Channel Layer

#### Implementation
- **`Sources/JanusShared/Tempo/TempoConfig.swift`:**
  - Chain-specific configuration: escrow contract, payment token, chain ID
  - Computes EIP-712 voucher domain ("Tempo Stream Channel", version "1")
  - `TempoConfig.testnet` preset for Hardhat/Anvil (chainId 31337)

- **`Sources/JanusShared/Tempo/Voucher.swift`:**
  - `Voucher` — cumulative payment authorization (channelId + cumulativeAmount), matches on-chain type
  - `SignedVoucher` — voucher + EIP-712 recoverable ECDSA signature (65 bytes: r || s || v)
  - `voucherEIP712Type` — `Voucher(bytes32 channelId, uint128 cumulativeAmount)`
  - `structHash` / `signableHash(config:)` — EIP-712 hashing chain
  - `sign(with:config:)` — signs voucher with secp256k1 key pair
  - `verify(signedVoucher:expectedSigner:config:)` — recovers signer address from signature, compares against expected
  - `recoverAddress(messageHash:signature:)` — Swift `ecrecover` using P256K.Recovery

- **`Sources/JanusShared/Tempo/Channel.swift`:**
  - `Channel` — on-chain escrow payment channel (payer, payee, token, salt, deposit, state)
  - `computeId()` — deterministic channel ID via `keccak256(abi.encode(...))`, mirrors on-chain computation
  - `ChannelState` — open / closeRequested / closed / expired
  - `acceptVoucher()` — validates monotonicity, deposit bounds, channel ID match
  - `recordSettlement()` — tracks on-chain settlement amount
  - `ChannelError` — typed errors for all validation failures

#### Tests
- **`TempoTests.swift`** — 17 tests:
  - Voucher: sign & verify, rejects wrong signer, rejects tampered amount, deterministic hashing
  - Address recovery: `ecrecover` round-trip
  - Channel ID: deterministic, differs for different params
  - Channel lifecycle: creation, accept voucher, settlement, monotonic sequence
  - Channel validation: non-monotonic rejected, exceeds deposit rejected, wrong channel rejected
  - Codable: Voucher and Channel JSON round-trips

#### Results
- JanusShared: BUILD SUCCEEDED
- 112/112 unit tests passing (95 previous + 17 Tempo)

#### Status: Step 2 COMPLETE

---

### Step 3a: Off-chain Voucher Integration (Protocol Layer)

#### Design
Tempo payment channels have two independent layers:
1. **Off-chain (vouchers):** Client signs EIP-712 vouchers, provider verifies via `ecrecover`. Pure crypto — no blockchain needed.
2. **On-chain (escrow):** Opening channels, depositing tokens, settling. Requires a real chain (Step 3b).

Step 3a implements the off-chain layer: new protocol messages and verification logic that replace Ed25519-based `SpendAuthorization` with EIP-712-based `VoucherAuthorization`.

#### Implementation
- **`Sources/JanusShared/Protocol/VoucherAuthorization.swift`:**
  - `VoucherAuthorization` — new protocol message wrapping `SignedVoucher` + requestID + quoteID
  - `ChannelInfo` — replaces `SessionGrant` for first-contact channel setup

- **`Sources/JanusShared/Verification/VoucherVerifier.swift`:**
  - `VoucherVerifier` — 8-step verification using ecrecover instead of Ed25519
  - `verifyChannelInfo()` — validates first-contact channel info

- **`MessageType.voucherAuthorization`** added to enum

#### Tests
- **`VoucherFlowTests.swift`** — 15 end-to-end tests covering happy path, all 7 error modes, channel info validation, and wire format round-trips

#### Results
- JanusShared: BUILD SUCCEEDED
- 127/127 unit tests passing (112 previous + 15 voucher flow)

#### Status: Step 3a COMPLETE

---

### Step 3a (cont): App-level Voucher Wiring

#### Design
Wire the off-chain Tempo voucher flow into the actual iOS (client) and macOS (provider) apps, creating a dual-path system that supports both Ed25519 `SpendAuthorization` and EIP-712 `VoucherAuthorization` sessions.

#### Implementation
- **`MPCAdvertiser.swift`:**
  - Made `serviceAnnounce` mutable
  - Added `updateServiceAnnounce(providerPubkey:providerEthAddress:)` — called after `ProviderEngine` initializes its keypairs, so the announce includes both the Ed25519 pubkey and Ethereum address

- **`ProviderStatusView.swift`:**
  - Calls `advertiser.updateServiceAnnounce()` in `.onAppear` with `engine.providerPubkeyBase64` and `engine.providerEthKeyPair?.address.checksumAddress`

- **`ClientEngine.submitRequest()`:**
  - Dual-path first-contact: sends `channelInfo` (Tempo) or `sessionGrant` (Ed25519) depending on `session.usesVouchers`
  - `PromptRequest` now carries both optional fields

- **`ClientEngine.handleQuote()`:**
  - Dual-path authorization: sends `VoucherAuthorization` (via `session.createVoucherAuthorization()`) or `SpendAuthorization` (via `session.createAuthorization()`) depending on `session.usesVouchers`
  - Marks `channelInfoDelivered` or `grantDelivered` after successful send

#### Results
- JanusProvider (macOS): BUILD SUCCEEDED
- JanusClient (iPhone): BUILD SUCCEEDED
- 127/127 unit tests passing (no regressions)

#### Status: Step 3a app wiring COMPLETE

---

### Step 3a Smoke Test + Bug Fixes

#### Device-to-device smoke test (Mac ↔ iPhone)
- Confirmed **both payment paths** work end-to-end over MPC:
  - Ed25519 (SpendAuthorization): session `D7A1C719...` in `knownSessions` + `spendLedger`
  - Tempo (VoucherAuthorization): session `1705C527...` — receipt issued but NOT in `knownSessions`/`spendLedger` (fingerprint of voucher path using in-memory `channels`)
- Codable round-trips for `EthAddress`, `EthSignature`, `SignedVoucher`, `ChannelInfo` all serialize correctly across iOS ↔ macOS

#### Bug: Stuck "Processing..." after phone lock/unlock
**Root cause:** Tempo channel identity mismatch on reconnect. ETH keypair is not persisted, so client creates a new one after restoring session from disk → new channel ID. Provider ignored the updated `channelInfo` (checked `channels[sessionID] == nil`, found old channel, skipped). Client sent `VoucherAuthorization` with new channel ID → provider couldn't find it → silently dropped with no error → client waited forever.

**Fixes:**
- **`ProviderEngine.handlePromptRequest()`:** Always accept updated `channelInfo` (removed `if channels[sessionID] == nil` guard). Handles client reconnect with new keypair.
- **`ProviderEngine.handleVoucherAuthorization()`:** Send error back to client when voucher channel is unknown (was just printing and returning silently).
- **`ClientEngine`:** Added 20-second request timeout as safety net for any future message-loss scenarios. Proactively calls `checkConnectionHealth()` on submit.

**Verified:** Lock phone → unlock → reconnect → send request → works.

#### Remaining for persistence (deferred to 3b)
- Persist ETH keypair in `PersistedClientSession` so channel doesn't change on reconnect (proper fix)
- Persist provider-side `channels` dict for crash recovery

---

### Step 3b: On-chain Integration with Tempo Testnet

#### Context
Tempo is an EVM-compatible L1 blockchain optimized for payments. Key differences from Ethereum:
- **No native gas token** — fees paid in USD stablecoins (TIP-20 tokens)
- Higher state creation costs (250k gas for new storage slot vs 20k on Ethereum)
- Fast finality (~0.5s blocks)
- Custom Foundry fork with `--tempo.fee-token` flags

#### Tempo Testnet (Moderato) Details
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Network Name | Tempo Testnet (Moderato) |
| Chain ID | `42431` |
| RPC URL | `https://rpc.moderato.tempo.xyz` |
| Explorer | `https://explore.testnet.tempo.xyz` |
| Currency | USD (no native token) |
| pathUSD | `0x20c0000000000000000000000000000000000000` |
| Faucet | `cast rpc tempo_fundAddress <ADDR> --rpc-url https://rpc.moderato.tempo.xyz` |
| Foundry | `foundryup -n tempo` (Tempo fork installed) |

#### Design

We deploy our own `StreamEscrow` contract to Tempo testnet. The escrow:
1. Holds TIP-20 stablecoin deposits from clients (payers)
2. Verifies EIP-712 voucher signatures for settlement
3. Pays providers (payees) based on the latest cumulative voucher

**Key changes from Step 3a:**
- Payment token: pathUSD (`0x20c0...0000`) instead of `address(0)` (no native ETH on Tempo)
- Chain ID: `42431` instead of `31337` (Hardhat)
- TempoConfig: real escrow contract address after deployment
- Channel ID computation now uses real escrow address + real chain ID

**EIP-712 domain (unchanged structure):**
- name: "Tempo Stream Channel"
- version: "1"
- chainId: 42431
- verifyingContract: `<deployed escrow address>`

**Escrow contract functions:**
- `openChannel(payee, token, salt, authorizedSigner, amount)` — client deposits TIP-20 tokens
- `getChannel(channelId)` → returns on-chain channel state (deposit, settled amount, open flag)
- `settle(channelId, cumulativeAmount, signature)` — provider claims payment via EIP-712 ecrecover
- `closeChannel(channelId)` — finalize and return remaining deposit to payer

**Channel ID** = `keccak256(abi.encode(payer, payee, token, salt, authorizedSigner, escrow, chainId))` — matches our existing `Channel.computeId()`.

#### Implementation Progress

**Phase 1: Smart Contract** ✅
- [x] Created Foundry project at `contracts/` with tempo-std, solady, forge-std
- [x] Wrote `TempoStreamChannel.sol` — reference implementation from Tempo TIPs
- [x] Wrote `TempoUtilities.sol` — isTIP20() wrapper for factory precompile
- [x] Deployed to Tempo Moderato testnet (chain ID 42431)
- [x] **Contract address**: `0xaB7409f3ea73952FC8C762ce7F01F245314920d9`
- [x] **Domain separator**: `0x838cdeffc3b733fce6d75c74ebef34992efe2f79039073514982955f6caa7bba`
- Deployer: `0x1A1F1C6132f634484EbB35954f357FC16A875D3D` (testnet only)

**Phase 2: Swift JSON-RPC Client** ✅
- [x] `Sources/JanusShared/Ethereum/EthRPC.swift` — async JSON-RPC over HTTP (eth_call)
- [x] `Sources/JanusShared/Tempo/EscrowClient.swift` — typed wrapper for `getChannel(bytes32)` and `computeChannelId(...)`
- [x] Custom `UInt128` type for Solidity uint128 deposit/settled amounts

**Phase 3: App Integration** ✅
- [x] Updated `TempoConfig.testnet` with real contract address, chain ID 42431, pathUSD token, RPC URL
- [x] Provider: async on-chain verification in `handlePromptRequest()` via `verifyChannelInfoOnChain()`
  - Checks channel exists, payee matches, authorizedSigner matches, not finalized
  - Falls back to off-chain-only if RPC unreachable or channel not yet opened
- [x] Client: ETH keypair persisted in `PersistedClientSession.ethPrivateKeyHex`
- [x] Client: `setupTempoChannel()` reuses persisted ETH keypair (prevents channel ID mismatch on reconnect)
- [x] Client: uses pathUSD token address in channel setup
- [x] All 127 tests pass

**Phase 4: Auto On-Chain Channel Opening** ✅
- [x] `Sources/JanusShared/Ethereum/RLP.swift` — RLP encoding for Ethereum transaction serialization
- [x] `Sources/JanusShared/Ethereum/EthTransaction.swift` — legacy tx building with EIP-155 signing, `approve`/`openChannel` builders
- [x] Extended `EthRPC.swift` — `sendRawTransaction`, `getTransactionCount`, `gasPrice`, `waitForReceipt`, `fundAddress`
- [x] `Sources/JanusShared/Tempo/ChannelOpener.swift` — orchestrates fund → approve → open (idempotent)
- [x] `SessionManager` auto-opens channel on-chain after `setupTempoChannel()` (async, non-blocking)
- [x] `ProviderEngine` added `os_log` for client channel info capture (subsystem `com.janus.provider`, category `SmokeTest`)
- [x] Fixed `EscrowClient` decoder: handles both 256-byte and 288-byte `getChannel` returns
- [x] Gas limits set to 2M for both approve and open (Tempo fee token mechanism adds significant overhead)
- [x] Live smoke test: both iPhones auto-funded, approved escrow, opened channels on Tempo Moderato testnet
- [x] 160/160 tests passing (11 new: RLP encoding, tx builders, live integration test)

Key discoveries:
- Tempo uses custom transaction type 118 (`0x76`) with `feeToken` field, but **legacy type 0 transactions also work**
- Gas accounting on Tempo includes fee token overhead — 60K gas limit fails even for a simple `approve` (~531K actual)
- `print()` in macOS GUI apps doesn't appear in unified log — must use `os_log()` for CLI log capture
- `getChannel()` returns 256 bytes (no ABI offset pointer), not 288 as initially assumed

**Phase 5: On-Chain Settlement by Provider** ✅
- [x] `Sources/JanusShared/Ethereum/EthTransaction.swift` — added `settleChannel()` builder with dynamic `bytes` ABI encoding (offset + length + padded signature)
- [x] `Sources/JanusShared/Tempo/ChannelSettler.swift` — submits settlement tx using provider's ETH keypair; checks on-chain state first to avoid wasting gas
- [x] Provider ETH keypair persisted in `PersistedProviderState.ethPrivateKeyHex` (survives restarts)
- [x] `ProviderEngine.settleAllChannelsOnChain()` — triggered on client disconnect, parallel to existing Ed25519 backend settlement
- [x] Signature v conversion: 0/1 → 27/28 (`ethV`) for on-chain `ecrecover`
- [x] `testFullSettlementOnTempo` integration test: open channel → sign 3 vouchers → provider settles → verify on-chain `settled=9`
- [x] 162/162 tests passing, both apps build

Key details:
- Settlement is idempotent — contract ignores amounts ≤ already-settled
- Dual settlement paths: Ed25519 sessions → Janus backend HTTP; Tempo channels → on-chain escrow contract
- Provider persists `settledSpends[sessionID]` to allow re-settlement when more spend accumulates
- Provider must be funded with pathUSD on Tempo for gas (no native ETH on Tempo — gas paid in stablecoin)

#### Offline-First Smoke Test (2026-03-25) ✅

End-to-end test proving the core Janus thesis: **blockchain only needed at the edges (escrow open + settlement), entire service delivery happens offline.**

**Devices:**
- Provider: Mac (JanusProvider with MLX Qwen3-4B) — ETH `0x52109e2F353f1f6Bc0796b1E852acdB400BC531d`
- Client: iPhone 16 (JanusClient) — ETH `0x08526625F4257704E43F272CcC23994ee302B76a`
- Escrow: `0xaB7409f3ea73952FC8C762ce7F01F245314920d9` on Tempo Moderato (chain 42431)
- Channel ID: `0xa48371be0034a1cb0b6784bbf120065784ecfcd4b20bd7aed96297db04e38be6`

**Phase 1 — Online (channel opening):**
- Client auto-funded via Tempo faucet, approved escrow, opened channel with deposit=100 pathUSD credits
- All 3 on-chain txs (fund, approve, open) executed automatically by the client app

**Phase 2 — Online requests (6 requests, 18 credits):**
- 6 translation requests served via MPC + MLX inference + EIP-712 voucher signing
- Each voucher is cumulative: voucher #6 authorizes provider to claim up to 18 credits total
- Provider settled on-chain when client briefly disconnected:
  - **Settlement TX 1**: `0x9b1df3bf1a72a300f7fa9e049e1c42be3191c538c2f53b3e0d65db18db669ebe` — 18 credits
  - On-chain state: `deposit=100, settled=18`

**Phase 3 — Offline requests (WiFi off, 2 more requests, 6 more credits):**
- Disconnected WiFi on both Mac and iPhone
- Sent 2 more translation requests — all worked identically:
  - MPC (Multipeer Connectivity) over Bluetooth/peer-to-peer WiFi — no internet gateway
  - MLX inference ran locally on Mac GPU — no cloud API
  - Voucher signing/verification via pure local secp256k1 crypto — no chain needed
- Voucher #8 authorized cumulative 24 credits

**Phase 4 — Reconnect & settle:**
- Turned Mac WiFi back on
- Provider auto-settled the latest voucher (cumulative=24) on-chain:
  - **Settlement TX 2**: `0x1f255dc45a302f81b135479a0daa7b21ce1ac753f57bee86d583f93ebc76a98d` — 24 credits cumulative (delta of 6 transferred)
  - On-chain state: `deposit=100, settled=24, remaining=76`

**Issue encountered:**
- First settlement attempt at 10:32 failed with `insufficient funds for gas` — provider ETH address had 0 pathUSD. Fixed by funding provider via `tempo_fundAddress`. Subsequent settlements succeeded.

**Final on-chain state:**
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Deposit | 100 credits |
| Settled | 24 credits (8 requests × 3 credits) |
| Remaining | 76 credits |
| Provider earned | 24 pathUSD transferred from escrow to provider |

**Key takeaway:** The blockchain was touched only 5 times total (approve, open, failed settle, settle #1, settle #2). All 8 request/response cycles — including 2 fully offline — used only local compute and local crypto. The micropayment channel pattern amortizes expensive on-chain operations across many cheap off-chain voucher exchanges.

#### Bug: MPC discovery fails after screen lock + cellular toggle

**Symptom:** User locks iPhone screen, unlocks, turns off cellular data, taps "Scan" in JanusClient — provider is not found. MPC browsing appears active (spinner visible) but never discovers the provider's advertisement.

**Root cause:** Multipeer Connectivity uses Bonjour/mDNS for peer discovery, which binds to specific network interfaces at browse time. When iOS suspends the app (screen lock), MPC browsing silently stops. When the user then changes network state (e.g., toggling cellular off), the available interfaces change. On resume, `startSearching()` called `browser.startBrowsingForPeers()` on the existing `MCNearbyServiceBrowser` instance, but its Bonjour bindings were stale — still referencing interfaces from before the suspend/network change. The browser appeared to be browsing but was actually listening on dead interfaces.

**Fix (`JanusApp/JanusClient/MPCBrowser.swift`):**
- **`startSearching()`**: Changed from a simple `startBrowsingForPeers()` to a full stop → `resetSession()` → start cycle. This forces MPC to tear down old Bonjour bindings and re-enumerate available network interfaces (Bluetooth, WiFi peer-to-peer) from scratch.
- **`checkConnectionHealth()`** (called automatically via `UIApplication.willEnterForegroundNotification`): Previously only handled the case where the app thought it was connected but the peer was gone. Now always restarts browsing on foreground re-entry, regardless of connection state — catches the case where interfaces changed while suspended but the app was in `.disconnected` state with no reconnect pending.

**Key detail:** The `MCNearbyServiceBrowser` instance itself is reused (created once in `init`), but the underlying `MCSession` is recreated via `resetSession()`. The stop/start cycle on the browser is sufficient to force Bonjour to rebind — no need to recreate the browser object.

**Verified:** Lock iPhone → unlock → toggle cellular off → tap Scan → provider discovered immediately.

#### Bug: MPC stuck "Connecting" when WiFi radio is off

**Symptom:** Both Mac (provider) and iPhone (client) have WiFi completely off (not just disconnected from a network — the radio itself is disabled). iPhone also has cellular off. User taps "Scan" — client discovers the provider and shows "Connecting", but the connection never completes. Stays in connecting state indefinitely, silently retrying every 10 seconds.

**Root cause — MPC's three transport layers:**

| Layer | Purpose | Requires |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Bluetooth** | Peer **discovery** (finding nearby devices) | BT radio on |
| **AWDL (Apple Wireless Direct Link)** | Peer-to-peer **session data transfer** | WiFi radio on (no access point or internet needed) |
| **Infrastructure WiFi** | Session data when both on same network | Both on same WiFi network |

When WiFi is off on either device, Bluetooth can still discover the peer (so `foundPeer` fires and the UI shows "Connecting"), but AWDL is unavailable so the `MCSession` can never be established. The invitation times out, the code resets and retries, creating an infinite loop with no user feedback.

**This is distinct from the offline smoke test scenario:** In the smoke test, WiFi was **on** but **internet was off**. The WiFi radio being on is sufficient for AWDL — it creates an ad-hoc peer-to-peer WiFi link between devices without needing an access point or internet gateway. That's why the offline test worked: AWDL was available.

**Fix (`JanusApp/JanusClient/MPCBrowser.swift` + `DiscoveryView.swift`):**
- Added `consecutiveTimeouts` counter to `MPCBrowser`. After 2 consecutive connection timeouts (20 seconds total), transitions to new `.connectionFailed` state and stops retrying.
- New `ConnectionState.connectionFailed` case — surfaces to UI instead of silently looping.
- **`DiscoveryView`**: Shows orange `wifi.exclamationmark` icon with message: "Provider found but can't connect — WiFi must be enabled on both devices. Internet is not required — just the WiFi radio."
- Counter resets on successful connection or when user taps Scan again.

**Architectural insight — "offline" has two meanings for Janus:**
1. **No internet** (WiFi radio on, no gateway): Fully supported. AWDL provides peer-to-peer transport. This is the core Janus use case — all service delivery (MPC discovery, session setup, inference, voucher exchange) works without internet.
2. **No WiFi radio** (airplane mode / WiFi disabled): Not supported for data transfer. Bluetooth alone can discover peers but cannot reliably establish MPC sessions or transfer the data volumes needed for inference requests/responses. The fix ensures users get a clear, actionable error instead of infinite "Connecting...".

**Verified:** WiFi off on both devices → Scan → "Connecting" for ~20s → shows WiFi warning. Enable WiFi → tap Scan → connects immediately.

#### Multi-Client Smoke Test (2026-03-25) ✅

Two iPhones connected to the same Mac provider simultaneously, each with independent Tempo payment channels.

**Devices:**
- iPhone 16 (payer `0x0852...`) — channel `0xa483...`, deposit=100
- iPhone 14 Plus (payer `0x2f27...`) — channel `0xe096...`, deposit=100
- Provider (Mac) — `0x5210...`, serving both via separate MPC sessions

**Results:**
- Both clients discovered provider, connected, opened channels on-chain, and received inference responses
- Requests from both phones served concurrently (provider handles MPC sessions independently via per-client `MCSession`)
- On-chain settlements for both channels:
  - iPhone 16: settled **69 credits** (23 requests) — TX `0x885461d2...`
  - iPhone 14 Plus: settled **9 credits** (3 requests) — TX `0xa024c963...`
- Each channel is fully independent — separate payer addresses, separate channel IDs, separate voucher chains, separate on-chain settlements

#### Status: Step 3b COMPLETE (Phases 1–5 + Offline Smoke Test + Multi-Client Test + MPC bug fixes)

### Transport Reference: MPC / AWDL / Bluetooth

#### How Multipeer Connectivity works under the hood

MPC uses three transport layers, each with a distinct role:

| Layer | Role | Requires | Bandwidth | Range |
|-------|------|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Bluetooth LE** | Peer **discovery** (finding nearby devices) | BT radio on | ~0.3 Mbps | ~10-30m |
| **AWDL (Apple Wireless Direct Link)** | Peer-to-peer **session & data transfer** | WiFi radio on | ~20-80 Mbps | ~30-70m |
| **Infrastructure WiFi** | Data transfer (when both on same network) | Same WiFi network | Network speed | Router range |

- **Bluetooth** broadcasts "I'm here" advertisements. When the client's `MCNearbyServiceBrowser` discovers a provider's `MCNearbyServiceAdvertiser`, it fires `foundPeer`. This is discovery only.
- **AWDL** handles the actual `MCSession` handshake and all data transfer. It creates a **direct device-to-device WiFi link** — no router, no access point, no internet. Same technology as AirDrop. Uses 5 GHz band (channel-hops between device's WiFi channel and a dedicated AWDL social channel).
- If both devices are on the **same WiFi network**, MPC may use infrastructure WiFi instead of AWDL for better throughput.

#### Core requirement for Janus offline operation

| What | Required? |
|------|-----------|
| WiFi radio toggle ON | **Yes** (both devices) |
| Connected to a WiFi network | No |
| WiFi router / access point | No |
| Internet access | No |
| Bluetooth | Yes (for initial discovery) |
| Cellular data | No |

**"Offline" for Janus means no internet, NOT no WiFi radio.** The WiFi toggle powers on the radio chip; AWDL then creates a point-to-point link directly between devices. Two people in the middle of a desert with zero infrastructure can use Janus, as long as both have WiFi and Bluetooth toggled on.

#### Range expectations

| Environment | AWDL Range |
|-------------|------------|
| Indoor (walls, furniture) | ~10-15m (~30-50 ft) |
| Open space (line of sight) | ~30-70m (~100-230 ft) |
| Ideal (no interference) | Up to ~100m (~330 ft) |

Rule of thumb: if you can AirDrop to someone, Janus will work at that distance.

#### Why Bluetooth alone is insufficient

Bluetooth can discover peers but cannot reliably establish `MCSession` or transfer the data volumes Janus needs. This is an Apple architectural decision — MPC delegates session handshake and data to AWDL. A single Janus inference round-trip (PromptRequest → QuoteResponse → VoucherAuthorization → InferenceResponse) involves multiple messages of several KB each; Bluetooth's ~0.3 Mbps and unreliable connection setup make this impractical.

**Future option:** If true Bluetooth-only operation is needed (e.g., one device can't enable WiFi), we'd need to replace MPC with a custom **Core Bluetooth L2CAP channel** implementation. L2CAP gives ~1 Mbps bidirectional streams over BLE 5.0 — workable but slower, with significantly more connection management code.

**Phase 6: Production Key Management** — TODO (requires wallet SDK integration)

Current state: client generates raw secp256k1 key via `EthKeyPair()`, stored as plaintext hex in `client_session.json`. Private key is also logged via `os_log` (debug only). Not suitable for production.

- [ ] Integrate embedded wallet SDK (Privy, Web3Auth, or Turnkey) into JanusClient
- [ ] Replace `EthKeyPair()` with wallet-managed key (Secure Enclave / HSM-backed)
- [ ] Sign vouchers and transactions through wallet SDK (app never sees raw key)
- [ ] Add user authentication flow (email / Apple ID / SMS via wallet SDK)
- [ ] Add biometric confirmation for high-value operations (channel open, large deposits)
- [ ] Add key recovery (social recovery / cloud backup via wallet SDK)
- [ ] Remove debug logging of private keys (`CLIENT_ETH_PRIVKEY` os_log lines)
- [ ] Optional: fiat on-ramp integration for funding channels without pre-existing crypto
